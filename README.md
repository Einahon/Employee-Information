Employee Information RESTful API
Project Overview
The Employee Information RESTful API is a fully functional web service built with Gradle and Spring Boot. It provides an API to manage employee data, including Employee ID, first name, last name, title, and phone number. This application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, ensuring data integrity through input validation and error handling.

Features
CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records.
Input Validation: Ensures data is valid before being processed using Spring Validator.
Error Handling: Handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP responses.
MySQL Integration: Data is stored persistently in a MySQL database.
Unit Testing: Tests are implemented using JUnit to ensure the API functions as expected.
